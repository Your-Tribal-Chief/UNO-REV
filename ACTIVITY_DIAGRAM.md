## 🧠 SmythOS Integration Points

### Data Flow Architecture
```
Game State → SmythOS API → Analysis Engine → Decision Tree → Move Selection → Game Update
     ↑                                                                            ↓
Analytics Dashboard ← Performance Metrics ← Learning Engine ← Outcome Analysis ← Game Result
```

### AI Decision Process
```
1. INPUT: Current game state, player patterns, historical data
2. PROCESSING: 
   - Win probability calculation
   - Risk assessment algorithms
   - Personality trait application
   - Strategic optimization
3. OUTPUT: Optimal move recommendation with confidence score
4. FEEDBACK: Move outcome analysis for learning improvement
```

### Real-time Analytics Flow
